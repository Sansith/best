The next task which was easy and was done in short interval of time was the installation of SageMath and biber. I followed the instructions given in the readme file and used the commands one by one was able to install them.

Commands used to install SageMath using ppa repository are :
`sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:aims/sagemath`
`sudo apt-get update`
`sudo apt-get install sagemath-upstream-binary`

Command used to install biber are :
`sudo apt-get install biber`
