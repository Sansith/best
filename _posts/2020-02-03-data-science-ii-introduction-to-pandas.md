Pandas is an open source library built on the top of `NumPy` that allows us to analyse and clean the data for further step to be performed upon.

> Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.

Pandas is the next step that you need to know if you are starting out as a data scientist. As it is built on the top of Numpy, that is why studied about [Numpy](https://ranvir.xyz/blog/data-science-i-all-things-you-need-to-know-about-numpy/) first.

## Pandas features

* Pandas library has a built-in visualization which you can use which we are going to discuss in the next few parts.

* It can work with a wide variety of data sources and can help us to clean them up.

There are a lot of other features which you might find useful, but this is what we need for the start.

## How to install Pandas?

Installing Pandas is quite similar to installing Numpy as we did in the last part.

When in your virtual environment, use the following command

```shell
pip install pandas
```

## What are we going to learn?

We are going to learn various methods of the Pandas library which will help us to clean and analyze the code.

Some important terms we will be seeing in this post are:

* Series
* DataFrames
* Missing Data
* GroupBy
* Merging, Joining and Concatenating
...

## Series in Pandas

Pandas series are similar to Numpy Array except that the pandas series should contain some indexes.

Let's jump to the Jupyter notebook to learn more about the Pandas series.

[Pandas Series Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/singh1114/ml/blob/master/datascience/Pandas/Pandas%20Series.ipynb)

### Recap

In this notebook, we discussed,

* How to create Pandas series?

* How to create Pandas series with custom indexes?

* Creating series using Python dictionaries.

* How to select elements from pandas series?

* How to apply arithmetic operations in Pandas series?
