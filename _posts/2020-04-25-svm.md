SVM or support vector machines are supervised learning models that analyze data and recognize patterns on its own. They are used for both classification and regression analysis.

SVM model is the representation of the dataset as points in space, so that the example of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap which is as wide as possible.

Any new incoming data is then mapped to one of these few categories based on which side of the gap they fall on.

For example, in the above image we can clearly see that there are two categories in the dataset. Category blue and category pink.

Our aim to differentiate between the two categories. One simple way of doing that is to draw a line in between the two categories. But as we can see, there are a lot of lines which can clearly divide dataset into two parts.

What we actually do is that we choose a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes. The data points (Vectors) touching the two outer lines are called support vectors.

This simple example of two dimension linear plots can be further used in a dataset having further more dimensions. Each time our idea will be to draw a hyperplane which can divide the data into different categories.
