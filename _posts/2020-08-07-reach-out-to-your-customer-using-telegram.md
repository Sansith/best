I recently integrated [GoWeasel pop up](https://notifier.taskforge.co/) to my website which can allow my readers to get the latest updates of my blog using telegram with a single click.

All you have to do is to click on the `Get updates using telegram` widget's button and start a chat with my channel and every time I come up with new updates I will directly send them to your chatbox.

## How do you reach your readers?

I had a chat with [GoWeasel's CEO](https://notifier.taskforge.co/) who helped me to understand the inspiration behind the product. He used to manage a big blog with a subscribers count in several thousand.

> Do you assume that email is the best way to reach out to the audiences?

This was the first question that he asked me. I have been running this blog for some years now. I myself have a few hundred email subscribers in this blog. Every time I trigger a new newsletter email I see bad click rates myself and this is the main concern for him as well.

According to him, emails are all great until you get to the click rate for emails, which is too low.

Along with that, we have the concept of temporary emails.

Due to all these factors, you can’t be sure that the new user who subscribed to your newsletter will ever receive/read it.

Also, there is a possibility of users rarely checking their emails.

## Reach where your customers are

Today's analysis shows that people are highly using social platforms. If you are able to reach them on their favorite, you have the control.

There are a lot of benefits from having more than 1 channel of sending your newsletters.

* You don’t have to worry about your email getting banned by some email clients (You do, but not that much).
* You will get a higher click rate as these messaging platforms have higher opening rates and a better way of sending notifications.
* Get customer feedback directly into your account.
* You can personalize the messages in a far better way.

## Awesome tech support from the team

[GoWeasel's](https://notifier.taskforge.co/) team was very helpful in the process of integrating the product to my website. They helped me with the HTML and CSS required to integrate the widget to my website and helped me to add it as well.

## Benefits of using GoWeasel

I have already gained a few subscribers using the telegram bot. Now, these subscribers will get direct updates when I write something new. I can also send them the newsletter directly using GoWeasel's dashboard.

I can't see any loss in adding another way for the users to reach you directly.

## How to reach them

You can use their official [twitter handle](https://twitter.com/go_weasel) and message them if you want to integrate their tool on your website as well.
