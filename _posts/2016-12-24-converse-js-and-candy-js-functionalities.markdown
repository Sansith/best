I have tried both converse.js and candy for creating a chat application on the browser for some use. Both of them provide very good functionality. Both converse.js and candy are based on XMPP client and pull data from the ejabberd server and render it on the screen on the browser.

But somehow we ended up not using both of them. In this post, I am going to discuss the things that helped us to move forward leaving behind these clients.

[**converse.js**](http://conversejs.org)

The client is very good and aÂ lot of development is being done by the developers. Also, the interface of the client is very great and is similar to the interface of facebook messaging client. But there were some things that were not well in the client like:-



 	
  * There is no file transfer

 	
  * All of the groups were shown( even the once that were not required by the user)


[Candy](https://candy-chat.github.io/candy/)

This client is also very good. The best thing is that they have built everything as different plugins and if you want to install any of them you can do that separately. This gives a choice to everyone. But the things that were not great about this were:-



 	
  * history saving is not there

 	
  * Interface is not that great


Maybe we have not checked them properly so these points might change with the time. I am going to look into them properly.
