It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only. Bootstrap is the second most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 100,000 stars and 45,000 forks.
