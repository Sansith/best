Before talking about the training I want to tell about the various things that I am using while writing about them.
 	
  * Ubuntu 15.10 on my system 

**Day 1**

This is the day one at the training institute and Inder sir introduced Vim to us. He told us about the various modes of this text editor.

I installed this on my system by using the command.

```shell
sudo apt-get install vim
```


He told us about the various commands in the Vim. I liked the thinking of not moving your hand off the keyboard so I explored more about this. I used one of the great website of tech world called [linux.com](https://www.linux.com/learn/vim-101-beginners-guide-vim) for the reference purpose.

So lets start with the things that I have learned about Vim.

Why would you even try to move your time toward learning a full flagged text-editor. Vim is world's best text editor for a reason whenever you work with Vim you never have to move your hand off the keyboard. You don't need to go to mouse again and again and waste your time in the purpose. Your total typing speed will increase in the long run. Although their may be dip in the speed when you are trying it for the learning purpose but if you choose to start then this will the best decision that you might have made in a long time.

**Modes**

Many people in the tech may contradict this but in this post we will be talking about three modes in the vim. These three modes are



 	
  * Command Mode

 	
  * Insert Mode

 	
  * Last-Line Mode


We can check for the version of Vim by launching the command


<blockquote>vim -v</blockquote>


Press :q to quit this mode.

Whenever we open a file by placing a command


<blockquote>vim filename</blockquote>


where filename is the preffered name of your file, this command first checks for the  existence of the file. If the file exist then it opens it and if their is no file by this name then it create it and opens a blank file for us with ~ sign on the beginning of each line. This sign represents the empty line in the document. Now on giving this command the editor opens in the terminal only. The first mode in which the file opens is the command mode this mode is used is used move in the document i.e. you can press j to move the cursor one line down.(we will discuss more about the commands later.

We can switch to the to insert mode by using i key. Press i key to open this mode. You can change anything in the document when you are in this mode.

The other mode is Last-Line mode which used for other purposes like saving the file.

This is the basic overview of Vim. Please refer to other posts in the category
