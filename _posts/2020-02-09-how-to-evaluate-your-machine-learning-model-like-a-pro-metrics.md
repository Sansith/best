You are happy with your Machine Learning model. You go up to your clients and show them the new model. You are excited to run it on the new production data. Checking your eagerness, client asks this question.

> How accurate is your model?

What should be your answer to this question?

Today we are going to talk about the problem of calculating the accuracy of your model along with some code samples that will help you to calculate them easily.

## What is the process of evaluating your model?

So, Machine Learning is a simple way of predicting the results with the input that model has not seen before. For example, Predicting stock prices with the historical data related to that particular stock which can tell us, whether it would be profitable to buy a stock on particular day or not.

Evaluating a model is like checking the accuracy of model when test data is passed onto the model - a piece of data which the model has never seen before.

## Why do we need to evaluate our model?

In general, it is a good metric to come up with when we are talking about your model with the guys in other teams who don't understand tech.

No model is 100% correct and there is no perfect score you want to achieve. It simply depends on case to case basis. Also, sometimes giving wrong answer is better than giving very wrong answer.

For example if you are building a cancer detector depending upon the test reports of the patient. You might want to tell the patient might have `cancer` and finally get off with the real cancer test, rather than giving `no cancer` output from your model, when in reality the person had cancer.
