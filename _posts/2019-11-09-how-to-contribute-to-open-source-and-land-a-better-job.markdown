Open source is one of the best ways to get started with the real-world experience of the programming world and learning as quickly as possible. Also, open-source organizations are very keen and welcome new contributors to the platforms.

I have heard a lot of people saying that contributing to open-source projects is very difficult. I know it can be hard at first but believe me, there are far more harder things in the programming world than starting contribution to open source.

In this post, I am going to share the motivation and plan to write your first patch for the open-source organization that you love to use.

## Why should you contribute to open source.

I have been doing open source for quite some time now( Going on and off). My first interaction with the open-source was back in 2016-17 when I was writing my first proposal for Google summer of code.

I was trying a lot of organizations back then. I started out with the chat-based organization whose name I don't remember now.

They were writing a chat-based client using XMPP protocol and we wanted to implement this chatting system in our college so that everyone in the college can chat with one another using the roll numbers.

Although I was able to know the process of writing the code I don't think it ever got merged with the main code.

I tried a few others and finally, I ended up spending my summer writing code for an organization called [AboutCode](https://www.nexb.com/).

You can read about the experience [here.](https://singh1114.github.io/blog/gsoc_2017/)

Long story short, I know how to start off and write pull requests that organizations want to commit to there main code.

Before starting that let's discuss why we would want to do any open-source development at all.

### Learn to build end to end solutions.

Well, the first and foremost advantage of doing open-source is that you learn different things.

When you are doing open-source you have to complete the PRs which involve writing *code*, *tests* and *documentation* for the feature that you are building.

Sometimes you have to become the tester to test out the feature that other build to find out bugs and find mistakes to fix.

Mostly you will have to architect your own solution for the problems that you are solving as well. 

### Learn how to talk

### Get a lot of recommendations

### Good for your career



* Choose the organization
* Join all communication channels
