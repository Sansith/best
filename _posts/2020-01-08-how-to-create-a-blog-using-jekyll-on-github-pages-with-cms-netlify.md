Writing is way of expressing yourself to the outer world. I have been writing on this blog from a long time now.

I started this blog during my somophore year with the Google powered blogger website back then. As soon as I started finding some readers, I moved the blog to wordpress.

At that time I didn't realized that while making all these transitions, I am loosing a lot of SEO weight of my blog. I didn't understand much about SEO either.

Finally I settled with a Jekyll blog hosted on GitHub pages. Recently I started using netlify CMS as well for writing my posts.

In this post I want to share the way in which I was able to achieve this combination and you probably can copy this model as well.

Talking about the CMSes, I first used to write posts using a text editor, which gave me a lot of troubles while creating new posts.

I literally had to copy the frontmatter for all the posts, when I wanted to create a new post.

During the same time, I was trying my hands with Django as well. So, I decided to solve this problem using my newly learned skill and create a small CMS for my personal use.

I hosted it on Jeklog.com( Not available anymore).

The idea was to stop myself from writing and copying the same frontmatter again and again.

I kept the software up for like an year and gained a few 100 users without much marketing.

While sharing with some of the folks over the internet, I realized that this was something that already existed.

After I took down my project, I used [siteleaf](https://siteleaf.com). I had no major issues with the website.

It works perfectly, but since they had a limit of 100 articles in the developer plan, I had to remove this blog from their as well.

I have also tried jekyll-admin for a few days as well. But it is not mature as a product as compared to netlify.

After searching for a few days here and there, I was able to set it up.

Now I am writing this article using Netlify CMS, online.

## What do we need?

We need the following things

- GitHub account
- Netlify account

Explain how they works together.

## Choose your favourite Jekyll theme

Share a few resources from where the users can find out the themes they can use.

## How to open up your blog online?

Show them how to fork and other stuff.

## How to add netlify?

Show them everything related to this step.

## Adding more and more collections?

Adding capabilities of more collections and directories.

## How to change the frontmatter shown on the netlify page?

## Conclusion

Finally, I want to say that it is very important to have an online presence and share your thoughts with the outside world.

Blogs are the best ways of doing that and all the things that I have shared is totally free and will not even cost you a single dollar.

Hope you liked the post. Please leave a comment share it on social media to help us get more traction.
