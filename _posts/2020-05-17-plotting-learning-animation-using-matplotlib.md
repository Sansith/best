Plotting various things in the data analysis is the best part to make sense of your data. Matplotlib is one of the best library which everyone uses for this purpose and has a lot of capabilities.

Plotting a plot of data using Matplotlib is fairly is easy. All you have to do is to use different functions available in Matplotlib with different `x` and `y` values and Matplotlib will plot something for you.

In this post, we are going to talk about a special type of animation plot in which you can see how your neural network is learning different values of weights and threshold( Also known as bias).
