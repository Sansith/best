This article is not for the people who are still looking for a job as a developer. This is for the people who are in their first job and want to learn things so that they can make that big transfer in their career. There must be a guide that can tell, how much work is left.

**Note:** In this post, I am only going to share the pathway for a backend engineer. I would be happy to add if someone comes up with a similar pathway for `frontend`, `DevOps` or a `data scientist` role.

I am sure that this transformation must take some time along with your daily work. As you keep on facing new challenges every day in your day job, you should be working to learn these skills.

## Learn Database designing

This is considered as one of the most important soft skills which you should have so that you spend lesser time making changes to the database design during the later stages of the development.

Changing database design will probably take the most time during a code review. You should spend a good amount of time thinking about the way you should keep your data.

This is also applicable to the people who use the NoSQL database. It's always good to have at least some structure in the database which makes it easier to understand the logic of the code and will help you to debug it afterward.

Some of the important things that you should know are:

* Indexing
* Foreign keys
* Primary Keys
* Joins
* Normalizing

## Learn some DevOps

You don't really need to know much about the stuff but a basic understanding of things will always help. It's good to know about EC2s.

Also, sometimes you have to debug stuff related to DevOps, which might take to see different logs all over the places.

Maybe database instances are down or Redis is not working properly or Maybe `queue` is chocked or `SNS` is not being fired or maybe `lambda` is not being triggered.

There is a whole lot of stuff in the AWS console, you just need to know a few of the terms to get going in this case.

Always prefer to use shell rather than using editors for simple things to get you into the habit of using the shell.

## Learn how to debug

One of the most important things that working on a problem teaches you is that you learn how to debug properly. 

## Learn to write tests

## Learn about scaling issues

## Learn a little bit about security

## Learn about caching

## Learn to review code properly

## Maintain your personal websites

## Share your learnings

## Help out new joinings and business guys
