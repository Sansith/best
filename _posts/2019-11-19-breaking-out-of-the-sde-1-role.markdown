This article is not for the people who are still looking for a job. This is for the people who are in their first job and want to learn things so that they can make that big transfer in their career. There must be a guide that can tell, how much work is left.

**Note:** In this post, I am only going to share the pathway for a backend engineer. I would be happy to add if someone comes up with a similar pathway for `frontend`, `DevOps` or a `data scientist` role.

I am sure that this transformation must take some time along with your daily work. As you keep on facing new challenges every day in your day job, you should be working to learn these skills.

## Learn Database designing

This is considered as one of the soft skills which you should have so that you spend lesser time while writing the code for the problem that you are trying to solve.

Changing database design will probably take the most time during a code review. You should spend a good amount of time thinking about the way you should keep your data.

This is also applicable to the people who use the NoSQL database. It's always good to have at least some structure in the database which makes it easier to understand the logic of the code.
