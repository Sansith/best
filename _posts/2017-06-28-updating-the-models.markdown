Today I was working on another branch to write the code that can fill the database. I scanned some code and saved copied the results to open them in clean JSON format because I wanted to iterate over the results. I used the online the following JSON parser.

[http://json.parser.online.fr/](http://json.parser.online.fr/)

It is a website that shows clean results and you can correctly see what's going on. After checking out the results I found that there was some discrepancy with the database. So I left the work of filling database and started the work on updating the database.

This is the JSON result that helped me to create the changes in the database.

Following is the commit related to the change in the database.

[https://github.com/singh1114/scancode-server/commit/de5a93a08741f1150ab3fbaa7b57b82f2bc5054a](https://github.com/singh1114/scancode-server/commit/de5a93a08741f1150ab3fbaa7b57b82f2bc5054a)

After this, I went back to work on filling theÂ database. I will be able to push something tomorrow. It is a tough task to keep everything. If I wrote some bad code then it is going to be very hard to debug.
