Java is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Not only it is widely used, but it is also being used as the core part of the top software companies in the world. So, if your dream is to work for those top companies, you better know a little bit of Java.

This tutorial will help you to create a CRUD(Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete) based application. In this tutorial, we will create every API for a **school management system.**

## Outcome and Goals

After going through this guide, you will be able to build complex applications using Spring Boot framework.

I would encourage you guys to create a small project of your own as well as we move forward in this guide.

## Why Spring Boot?

While building a web application, the main goal of the developer is to get the application out as quickly as possible. The developer should not be worried about the configuring various layers of the system.

Spring Boot helps us to remove that hassle and helps us to build us stand-alone, production-ready applications that **Just works**.

With that definition, you might be feeling that this framework is just for small level applications. But that is not true. You can build fairly complex systems using this framework.

## Why not use Spring directly?

There are a lot of reasons why people started moving on from the Spring framework to the smaller level frameworks. One of them which makes the most sense is the complexity.

As Spring itself is a huge framework, its not always easy to get started and build the application.

You need to know a lot of things before you can start building the application.

Spring framework was originated to solve the commonly occurring problems in the Companies and providing a single framework that can solve them all. But as the time went on, building a simple CRUD based application become pretty hard in the case of Spring framework and Spring Boot came to the rescue.
