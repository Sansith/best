Installing LaTex was a fairly easy task to accomplish but was very time consuming because of the slow speed of the internet. It took me more then five hours to install this software into the system. The command used was :

    
    <code>sudo apt-get install texlive-full</code>


After applying this command the system asked me for the password and asked me again to continue the download of more than 3000 MB.

I used this tutorial as a reference while installing LaTex.
