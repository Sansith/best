[oso](https://www.osohq.com/) helps developers fast track authorization in their applications.

It's an open source policy engine that you embed in your application. You write policies using the oso policy language, called Polar, to determine who can do what in your application, then you integrate them with a few lines of Python code using our library.

We also have integrations for Flask and Django. oso launched in summer 2020 and has already been downloaded thousands of times and launched into production.

We'd love to hear feedback or questions as we continue to build new features â€“ [join us on Slack](https://oso-oss.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-gpma9cye-yVfWh75rY3YUUrKanbKeKA#/) or [open an issue](https://github.com/osohq/oso).
