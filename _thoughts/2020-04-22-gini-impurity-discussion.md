Gini Impurity is a measure to quantify the split that we make to the data and divide it into separate halves.

For example: If we split a loan provider dataset on the basis of salary, we might want to check how this split is performing in the real world.

Gini impurity along with Gini gain will help us find whether the split was good or not.
