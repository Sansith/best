An Open-source enthusiast and a quick learner with a love toward debugging and reading. Also, you can find me playing or talking about football in my free time. I share most of my knowledge through this blog.  

## More Information

* I am a firm believer in deep work and likes to stay under the radar for most of my work. Because of this ability, I was able to crack [**Google Summer of Code-2017**](https://ranvir.xyz/blog/gsoc_2017/). Also, I was a mentor of **GSoC-2019** in the same organization. You can find all my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/singh1114).

* I love to write about my learnings here, over at [dev.to](https://dev.to/singh1114) and have started writing a few articles over at [Soshace](https://blog.soshace.com/author/ranvir/).
