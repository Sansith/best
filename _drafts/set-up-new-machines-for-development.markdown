Losing access to your ssh key is one of the most dreadful situation for a developer. You will spend your full day creating the new ssh key getting the access to all machines back after you create this new ssh key.

I have been using the same ssh key for a while now. In between this time, I have faced a few challenges of changing jobs, SSD breaking a few times and many more.

Even after all those situations, the ssh key that I have used has never changed.
